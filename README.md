# Trip log

In Austria, the on-road practice component for learner drivers involves completing a minimum of 1,000 kilometers under the supervision of an experienced driver after issuing a drivers permit.
A crucial aspect of this process is the documentation of each on-road practice session in a log book. This log book serves as a record, requiring both the learner driver and supervisor to sign after each session. The information in the log book, detailing the practice drive, must be faithfully reported. Learners must submit the completed log book to the driving licence authority as part of the overall assessment process. This approach aims to track and verify that learner drivers have met the necessary on-road practice requirements before progressing further in getting the drivers license.

To digitilize this process, this application was created. The user can log all the driving sessions. The application is easy to use and very minimalistic. The purpose of automating the process of creating the trip log to present to the driving school is possible. 

These are the steps to create the pdf: 
  - Add all the necessary logs
  - Add signature for the companion (person who accompanied the driver) and the applicant (person getting the license)
  - Press Save

After the steps, a pdf is created in the "Downloads" folder of the android device.
